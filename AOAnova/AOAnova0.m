%%AOAnova  Anova for Ray's optoretinogram data
%
% Description:
%    Based on BL anovan tutorial.  This is what we said in the
%    pre-registration document.
%
%    After the above analysis, we will calculate descriptive statistics for
%    thepeak amplitude for each stimulus condition, (e.g.mean and median),
%    and compare and contrast the descriptive statistics between stimulus
%    conditions, sessions, and subjects. We will determine if reciprocity is
%    established by computing for each subject a two-wayANOVA (stimulus
%    condition x session) and determining if there is a significant main
%    effect on the average cone reflectance response of stimulus conditions,
%    of session, and whether there is any interaction. If necessary, a
%    post-hoc t-test will be used to determine where the differences in
%    cone reflectances lie. We will also determine if there is
%    intrasession variation (i.e.with the 3.53 Î¼W stimulus) by computing a
%    one-way ANOVA to analyze significant differences between response
%    means within a session, using a random split of the within-session
%    3.53 uW trials.

% random is a vector containing the indices of variables that should
% be considered random.  One's not listed are considered fixed.
%
% Set to [] to have all variables considered fixed.  Making the
% change does effect the significance of the main effect of some
% of the fixed variables, in some cases.  So we ought to understand
% clearly which we want when we design the anova.  Searching on
% 'fixed versus random effect anoval' on the web returns a number
% of reasonable clear descriptions.

% is why they change.  I am not completely sure that this is the correct interpretation.
