% This function estimates the residual static distortion not currently
% captured by the dewarping software. Unlike the original version, it loads the fringes inside the function.
%
%    @fringes_fullpath: The path to the fringes file from Alf Dubra's calibration software.
%
%    @fitstartind: The pixel value at which we begin to calculate the fit. Increase this if you have issues
%                  with noisy fits.
